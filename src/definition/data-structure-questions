Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans:Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently.
Efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient algorithms.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans:Traversing,Searching,Inserting,Deleting,Sorting,Merging
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Simulation.
what is an Array?
Ans:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans:ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java. Therefore array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them. Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not.
However, ArrayList only supports object entries, not the primitive data types.
what is LinkedList?
Ans:LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
LinkedList allows for constant-time insertions or removals using iterators, but only sequential access of elements.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans: In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location.
In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous
element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.
what is queue?
Queue Interface In Java. The java.util.Queue is a subtype of java.util.Collection interface. It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to inserting elements at the end of 
list and deleting elements from the start of list i.e. it follows FIFO principle.
what is stack?
Ans:Stack is the subclass of Vector which is dynamic in nature and its size goes on increasing as the elements are added to it. Stack class allows creating the pile of the elements where, last element added to the stack is taken out first.
This is also referred to as “Last in First Out” (LIFO).
what is FIFO and LIFO?
ANs:First In First Out and Last in First Out.
what is the order of complexity?
Ans:complexity is a rough approximation of the number of steps necessary to execute an algorithm.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
Ans:Tree represents the nodes connected by edges
what is graph in data structure?
Ans:Graph is a non linear data structure, it contains a set of points known as
nodes (or vertices) and set of linkes known as edges (or Arcs) which connets the vertices.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans:HashMap is non synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized. Iterator in the HashMap
is fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the
map structurally by adding or removing any element except Iterator's own remove() method.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans:RDBMS>>>Array, Network data model>>>Graph and Hierarchical data model>>>Trees.
How HashMap works in java?
Ans:HashMap in Java works on hashing principle.When we call put method, hashcode() method 
of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket location 
to store value object, which is actually an index of the internal array, known as the table.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans:All array accesses are checked at run time; an attempt to use an index that is less than zero or greater than
or equal to the length of the array causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
Ans:The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms 
used for traversing and searching a node in a graph.
What is Recursion?
Ans:Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a 
method calls itself to solve some problem. A method that uses this technique is recursive.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans:Linear data structures are in which all the data are arranged in sequence manner.for example:linked list,stack queue. Non linear data 
structure are in which all the data are arranged in random manner.for example :trees,graphs.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans:A theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm, usually the time or memory 
needed, given the problem size n, which is usually the number of items. Informally, saying some equation f(n) = O(g(n)) means it is less 
than some constant multiple of g(n). The notation is read, "f of n is big oh of g of n".
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
